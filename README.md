# Tree Traversal in Python (DFS & BFS)

This project is a small Python implementation of a tree structure built from connected nodes. It demonstrates how **depth-first search (DFS)** and **breadth-first search (BFS)** work on a graph-like tree using basic data structures.

The goal of this project is learning and experimentation rather than performance or production use.

## Features
- Node-based tree structure
- Bidirectional node connections
- Depth-first traversal (recursive)
- Breadth-first traversal (queue-based)
- Simple test tree with clear output

## How It Works
- Each Node stores a value and a list of connected nodes
- The Tree class performs DFS or BFS starting from the first node in the list
- Visited nodes are tracked to prevent revisiting

## Running the Program
Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then run:

trees.py
